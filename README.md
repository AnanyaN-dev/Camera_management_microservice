## Camera_Microservice
```
A modular FastAPI microservice for managing cameras, their video feeds(streams), configurations, and simulated online/offline heartbeat status.
The project follows a clean layered architecture: API → Service → Repository → Models.
Important: This project uses an in-memory repository for storage. There is no file-based or database in the current version.
Have written unit tests to test the functionalities using pytest.
```

## Requirements
```
Python 3.14.
Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt AND 
Used mypy , black and isort code formatters for clean coding practices.
```

## What this service supports:
### Camera Operations :
```
Add a camera,
Get camera by id,
List cameras with filtering and pagination,
Update camera,
Delete camera,
Send heartbeat,
Check online/offline status.
```

### Feed Operations:
```
Add a feed to a camera,
List feeds with optional filters,
Update feed,
Delete feed.
```

## Auto-Heartbeat Logic
```
The system automatically updates a camera’s last_known_checkin (heartbeat) whenever:

1. A camera is added
2. A camera is updated
3. A feed is added of the camera
4. A feed is updated of the camera
5. A feed is deleted of the camera

This means:
- Any activity on a camera marks it as "online"
- If no activity occurs for HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT seconds, the camera becomes "offline"
```

This logic is implemented inside `camera_service.py` using:

```python
cam.last_known_checkin = datetime.now(timezone.utc)
cam.last_updated_on = datetime.now(timezone.utc)
self.repo._store[camera_id] = cam
```
Manual heartbeat `POST /cameras/{id}/heartbeat` still works, but is optional, for checking.

## Logging System
```
The microservice now has full logging for:
API layer,
Service layer,
Repository layer.
```

### Logging Features:
- Console logs (visible in terminal)
- JSON formatted logs saved to file
- Rotating log file system

### Log File Location:
```
logs/app_logs.json
```

### What gets logged:
```
Every camera action (add, update, list, delete)
Every feed action
All validation failures
All repository operations
Online/offline checks
```

Everything is logged using messages like:

```
[SERVICE] Adding new camera
[REPO] Starting process to add new camera
API: Camera successfully added
```

---

## Core Rules and Validations
```
1. Camera IP addresses must be unique. Two cameras cannot share the same IP addresses.
2. Camera name and model combination must also be unique, orelse will throw an error.
3. Each camera has one or more video feeds or not.
4. Each feed must have a unique protocol + port combination within the same camera id.
5. Heartbeat updates the camera's last check-in timestamp, when sent /heartbeat in endpoint(it will activate)(FOR CHECKING). But the last_checkin for all the cameras is updated automatically when camera operations takes place.
6. A camera is considered online only if its last heartbeat is within the configured timeout.
        # now = datetime.now(timezone.utc)
        # diff = now - cam.last_known_checkin
7. Listing cameras supports filtering by:
   model substring
   IP range
   online/offline status
8. Pagination is supported for camera and feed listing(GET METHOD).
9. The project uses an in-memory repository storing everything in runtime memory only.
```

## Environment Settings
```
Create a `.env` file locally.
Example keys:
HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT= # in seconds
DEFAULT_RTSP_HQ_PORT= #port num
DEFAULT_RTSP_LQ_PORT= #port num
DEFAULT_HTTP_PORT= #port num
```
## Run the application
```
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

## Documentation : Autogenerated by the FastAPI
```

```

## Tests
```
Run tests using:
python -m pytest -v
python -m pytest --cov=app
python -m pytest --cov=app --cov-report=term-missing -vv
```

## Notes about storage
```
The project uses an in-memory repository implemented in `memory_repo.py`.
There is no database, and no data persists after the server stops.
```

## Postman
```
The Postman collection is available at:
docs/postman/camera_management_collection.json

Import this file into Postman and set:
{{base_url}} = http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

## Diagrams:
```
Sequence diagrams for camera operations and feed operations are available in `/diagrams` as `.mmd` files.
These can be embedded into the README or exported as images using mermaid-cli.
And also: Figma diagram for better understanding : https://www.figma.com/board/arM87DpfudfKm6Az9e7Bve/Camera-Operations-Flow?node-id=0-1&t=NvRnNAYnaGv1l58t-1
